# Currently known list of bugs:
* Using AML causes a delayed game launch when started via Steam, unknown if this is directly related to AML or if it's some issue exclusive to my machine.

* When using Korama's CPKREDIR, Episode 2 can sometimes soft-lock when loading files. This may be an existing issue as Sonic Generations suffers the same bug.
