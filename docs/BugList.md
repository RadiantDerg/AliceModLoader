# Currently known list of bugs:
* AML causes a very slow launch when the game is started from Steam. It's unknown if this is directly AML's fault, or if it's some issue on my machine.

* When using Korama's CPKRedir.dll, Episode 2 can sometimes soft-lock when loading files. This may be an existing issue with CPKRedir, as Sonic Generations suffers the same bug.

* Episode 2's launcher crashes [(Issue link)](https://github.com/RadiantDerg/AliceModLoader/issues/1)
