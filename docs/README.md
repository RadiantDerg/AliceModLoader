# AliceModLoader
 **AliceModLoader (AML)** is a *very basic DLL mod loader* for the Sonic The Hedgehog 4 PC games.â€ 
 
**"Alice"** is derived from Sonic 4's internal application name.

<br/>

### Notice:
 I do **NOT** consider this to be in a widely usable state. **AML is currently hard-coded to just load 2 modules**. This will be addressed soon.
 
â€  This has only been actively tested with Episode 2. <i>Episode 1 is supported by extension, but remains largely un-tested</i>
