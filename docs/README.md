# AliceModLoader
 **AliceModLoader (AML)** is a *very basic DLL mod loader* for the Sonic The Hedgehog 4 PC games.â€ 
 
 This loader is purposefully named similarly to other existing loaders for PC Sonic games, the name **"Alice"** coming from Sonic 4 Episode 2's internal NN Application name.

### Notice:
 I do **NOT** consider this to be in a publicly usable state at all. **AML is currently hard-coded to just load 2 modules**,
 and is honestly low priority for me since I only needed something to load my in-progress code mods automatically.â€ â€

<h5>â€  This has only been actively tested on with Episode 2. <i>Episode 1 is supported by extension, but largely un-tested</i> </h5>
<h5>â€ â€  Without having to rely on an external injection program AND without the need to patch the game executables themselves </h5>

### âš  You will need to clear the build events before compiling
<h6>They simply just copy the compiled binaries to set locations on my machine, automating testing process.</h6>
