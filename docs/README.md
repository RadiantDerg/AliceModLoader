# AliceModLoader
 **AliceModLoader (AML)** is a *very basic DLL mod loader* for the Sonic The Hedgehog 4 PC games.â€ 
 
 This loader is purposefully named similarly to other existing loaders for PC Sonic games, the name **"Alice"** coming from Sonic 4 Episode 2's internal NN Application Library name.

### Notice:
 I do **NOT** consider this to be in a publicly usable state at all. **AML is currently hard-coded to just load 2 modules**,
 and is honestly low priority for me since I only needed something to load my in-progress code mods automatically.â€ â€

<h5>â€  This has only been actively tested on with Episode 2. While Episode 1 is technically already supported, it's limited to Sonic_xp.exe, as Sonic_vis.exe was intended for Windows Vista and up, since it relies on Direct3D9Ex instead of Direct3D9</h5>
<h5>â€ â€  *Without having to rely on an external injection program **AND** without having to completely patch the game executables themselves* </h5>
